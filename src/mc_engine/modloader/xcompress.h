// Host-side decoder for the game's XCompress LZX streams.
//
// Character resources are stored LZX-compressed (XCompress). The recompiled
// game decompresses them itself through XMemDecompressStream, but the modloader
// has to crack one open on the host to use it as a template.
//
// This used to go through xcompress32.dll's LZXDecompress. The copy that was
// being shipped was a Debug build importing VCRUNTIME140D.dll and
// ucrtbased.dll, so LoadLibrary failed on any machine without Visual Studio
// and every mesh mod was skipped with "xcompress32.dll missing". The SDK
// already carries libmspack's LZX decoder for XEX images (rex/system/lzx.h),
// and once the XCompress chunk headers are peeled off it takes these streams
// as they are: all 14,928 resources in xarchive_cache.rpf decode byte for
// byte the same as the DLL did.
